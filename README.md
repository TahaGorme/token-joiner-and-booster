# Discord Server Joiner and Booster

Discord Server Joiner and Booster is a script that allows you to automatically join a Discord server using multiple user tokens and boost them. This script also supports server boosting and 2captcha API and Capmonster.cloud API key for captcha solving.



## Installation

Download [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)



```javascript
git clone https://github.com/TahaGorme/token-joiner-and-booster.git
```

```javascript
cd token-joiner-and-booster
```

```bash
npm i
```

```javascript
node .
```
## Config

The config.json file contains the following properties:
- `captcha_service`: (optional) Your Captcha service (2Captcha or Capmonster)
- `captcha_api_key`: (optional) Your 2captcha or Capmonster API key for solving captchas.
- `invite`: The invite or invite code for the Discord server you wish to join.
- `joinDelay`: The delay (in milliseconds) between each join attempt.
- `useProxies`: Enable it if you want to use proxies (fill proxies in proxies.txt)
- `boost`: (optional) An object containing properties for server boosting.
    - `enabled`: Whether or not you want to boost the server on joining.
    - `delay`: The delay (in milliseconds) before boosting the server.
    - `serverId`: The ID of the server to boost.

### Program Usage

The program will automatically attempt to join the server using each token provided in the tokens.txt file. The `joinDelay` property determines the delay between each join attempt. 

If server boosting is enabled, the program will wait for the specified delay before boosting the server with the first available boost.


## Proxy Usage
If `useProxies` is enabled in the config, the program will use proxies from proxies.txt.
This program only supports `http` and `https` proxies.
proxies should be in the format `https://username:password@ip:port` if the proxy has authentication or `https://ip:port` if the proxy does not have authentication. 
NOTE: the http prefix is mandatory before the proxy 

### Error Handling

The program includes error handling for unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions. If an error occurs, the program will log the error message and continue running.
